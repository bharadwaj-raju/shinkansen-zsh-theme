# <img src="http://rawgit.com/bharadwaj-raju/shinkansen-zsh-theme/master/img/icon.png" height="40px" width="40px" /> Shinkansen zsh theme

Shinkansen is a ZSH (Z Shell) theme.

It aims for simplicity and minimalism, showing only minimal information.

It is *not* a fancy git/rails/python/etc. info prompt.
It is just a prompt, useful nevertheless.

Shinkansen is [customizable](#customization) and [extensible](#custom-segments-and-extensions).

It currently shows:
- A *running* clock (24-hour or 12-hour, or [custom `date` command](#time))
- Current directory
- Background jobs
- Exit code of last command

For a tmux theme to work with it, I suggest [Maglev](https://github.com/caiogondim/maglev).

## Preview

![Preview](http://raw.github.com/bharadwaj-raju/shinkansen-zsh-theme/master/img/preview.gif)


## Requirements

In order to use the theme, you will first need:

- Powerline compatible fonts like [Vim Powerline patched fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts), [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com/) or [Monoid](http://larsenwork.com/monoid/).
- ZSH

Make sure terminal is using 256-colors mode with `export TERM="xterm-256color"`

For [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/) users, make sure you go into your settings and set both the regular font and the non-ascii font to powerline compatible [fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or the prompt separators and special characters will not display correctly.

## Installation

Download [shinkansen.zsh-theme](https://raw.github.com/bharadwaj-raju/shinkansen-zsh-theme/master/shinkansen.zsh-theme) (*Right-click* â†’ *Save link as*) to a convenient location.

Simply:

```bash
source /path/to/shinkansen.zsh-theme
```

That's it.

You can also use it with Zplug, Zgen, oh-my-zsh, prezto or whatever plugin manager you use.

## Options

Shinkansen is configurable. You can change colors, the segment order, add custom segments and which segments you want
or don't want to see. All options must be overridden in your `.zshrc` file.

### Order
`SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER` defines order and enable/disable of prompt segments. Use zsh array
syntax to specify your own order, e.g:

```bash
SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER=(
	time
	status
	custom
	context
	dir
)
```

(That was the default.)

### Custom segments and extensions

Add the segment's name to `SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER` as follows:

```bash
SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER=(
	time
	status
	custom
	context
	dir
	sayhello
)

```
Create a function as follows:

```bash
prompt_sayhello() {
	prompt_segment yellow blue "hello"
}
```

The naming rule for such functions is `prompt_` + the segment's name.

*NOTE:* Such functions should be defined *before* the `source` or enabling of the plugin.

That's it.

### Built-in segment customization

See below for each one's options.

Set the value of each option-variable *before* the `source` part or before enabling the plugin.
