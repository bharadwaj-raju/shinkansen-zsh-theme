# Shinkansen zsh theme

Shinkansen is a ZSH (Z Shell) theme. It aims for
simplicity and minimalism, showing only minimal information.

It is *not* a fancy git/rails/python/etc. info prompt. It is just a prompt, useful nevertheless.

It currently shows:
- A running clock (yes, *running*!)
- Current directory
- Background jobs
- Exit code of last command

For a tmux theme to work with it, I suggest [Maglev](https://github.com/caiogondim/maglev).

## Preview

![Preview](http://raw.github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train-oh-my-zsh-theme/master/img/preview.gif)


## Requirements

In order to use the theme, you will first need:

* Powerline compatible fonts like [Vim Powerline patched fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts), [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com/) or [Monoid](http://larsenwork.com/monoid/).
* ZSH

Make sure terminal is using 256-colors mode with `export TERM="xterm-256color"`

For [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/) users, make sure you go into your settings and set both the regular font and the non-ascii font to powerline compatible [fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or the prompt separators and special characters will not display correctly.

## Installation

Download [shinkansen.zsh-theme](https://raw.github.com/bharadwaj-raju/shinkansen-zsh-theme/master/shinkansen.zsh-theme) (*Right-click* â†’ *Save link as*) to a convenient location.

Simply:

```bash
source /path/to/shinkansen.zsh-theme
```

That's it.

You can also use it with Zplug, Zgen, oh-my-zsh, prezto or whatever plugin manager you use.

## Options

Shinkansen is configurable. You can change colors, the segment order, add custom segments and which segments you want
or don't want to see. All options must be overridden in your `.zshrc` file.

### Order
`SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER` defines order of prompt segments. Use zsh array
syntax to specify your own order, e.g:

```bash
SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER=(
  context
  dir
  time
)
```

*NOTE:* You do not need to specify *end* segment - it will be added automatically.

### Custom segments

- Add the segment's name to `SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER` as follows:

```bash
SHINKANSEN_PROMPT_ORDER=(
  git
  dir
  sayhello
)

```
- Create a function as follows:

```bash
prompt_sayhello() {
  prompt_segment yellow blue "hello"
}
```

That's it.
